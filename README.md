## About this lecture

This lecture will specifically focus on the Algorithms implementation. My example code will be demostrated in Python, but you can adopt any kind of programming language if you prefer.

No slides are distributed (cuz. I do not regard slides as effecient format to display codes) but all of the codes and explanations are showed on this `README.md`.

Following topics will be covered in the Interest Group
